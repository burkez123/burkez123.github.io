  <h1>About Me</h1>
 <p1>My name is Zach Burke and I am currently a senior at Canyon Crest Academy. I am originally from Houston, Texas, born there on November 22, 1999, but now I reside in San Diego, California with my mom, brother, sister, along my 2 dogs and 3 cats. I am currently looking at colleges I want to go to, most of the ones I am looking at are in Texas, such as University of Texas, Texas Christian University, Baylor University, and a few others. I want to go to school in Texas because I like it better there, my family owns a cattle ranch west of Houston and I like staying there and working with the cattle. Once I go to school in Texas, I want to study either accounting to become a CPA, or study engineering and become a civil engineer and potentially work for the government.The reason I am creating this website is to allow others to overall know who I am, what are my hobbies, what movies, sports, foord, etc. that I like.
