<h1>Zachary Burke Bio</h1>
<p>My name is Zach Burke and I am currently a senior at Canyon Crest Academy. I am originally from Houston, Texas, born there on November 22, 1999, but now I reside in San Diego, California. I am currently looking at colleges I want to go to, most of the ones I am looking at are in Texas, such as University of Texas, Texas Christian University, Baylor University, and a few others. I want to go to school in Texas because I like it better there, my family owns a cattle ranch west of Houston and I like staying there and working with the cattle. Once I go to school in Texas, I want to study either accounting to become a CPA, or study engineering and become a civil engineer and potentially work for the government.</p>
