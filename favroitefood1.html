Olive oil
<p>
1 pound lean ground beef (chuck)
<p>
1/2 onion, diced, about 3/4 cup
<p>
1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), stem and core removed, diced, about 3/4 cup
<p>
2 cloves garlic, minced
<p>
1 28-ounce can good quality tomato sauce
<p>
3 ounces (half a 6-oz can) tomato paste
<p>
1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes
<p>
2 Tbsp chopped fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano
<p>
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed
<p>
1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning
<p>
Pinch of garlic powder and/or garlic salt
<p>
1 Tbsp red or white wine vinegar
<p>
1 Tbsp to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)
<p>
Salt
<p>
    <h3>Lasagna:</h3>
<p>
1/2 lb dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)
<p>
15 ounces Ricotta cheese
<p>
1 1/2 lb (24 ounces) Mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced
<p>
1/4 lb (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese
<p>
Cooking Utensils You'll Need:
<p>
A large skillet to brown the beef, bell pepper, and onion
<p>
A large pot (8 to 12-quarts) for cooking the pasta
<p>
A medium sized pot (3 to 4 quarts) to simmer the sauce
<p>
13" x 9" x 2" lasagna pan, preferably pyrex or stainless steel (avoid aluminum pans if you can, they can react 
with the acidity of the sauce)
<p>
A large colander to drain the noodles
<p>
A couple large sheet pans to cool the noodles
<p>
A large slotted cooking spoon
<p>
A large wooden cooking spoon
<p>
A chef's knife or large paring knife to cut the vegetables
<p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
1 Put pasta water on to boil: Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.
<p>
2 Brown the ground beef: In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook it until it is lightly browned on all sides.
Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. If there is more than a tablespoon of fat left in the pan (there shouldn't be if you are using lean ground beef) remove it from the pan.
<p>
3 Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef: Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).
Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.
4 Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce: Transfer the beef pepper onion mixture to a medium sized (3 to 4 quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.
