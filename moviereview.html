  <h2>Review</h2>
  
<p1>It is quite normal to be afraid of clowns, scientists and psychologists say that due to clowns having their face covered up with paint, and having their expressions (smiles or frowns) greatly enlarged, it causes the human brain to not be able to tell whether or not this person is a threat to them, so fear is the natural solution to this delimma.</p1>
  <p>
<p2>In this movie, the clown in the town of Derry, Maine is no normal clown, it is a clown lurking in the sewers and haunting kids in their daily lives, where if he catches them he will eat them, and that itself is a very terrifying. The acting in this movie compared to the first IT and its TV series is much better, in the movie and TV series, the way Tim Curry acts as Pennywise is quite hilarious, and it not too scary for any normal person without a severe case of clown phobia. In this IT though, Bill Skarsgard does a more subtle and creepy approach to being Pennywise, for example, other than the opening scene with Georige, not once does he blink as Pennywise, that makes him seem much less human and more menacing (Anthony Hopkins used the same approach in Silence of the Lambs)
<p>
<p3>Not only is acting in the movie a reason for the increased creepiness and horror of the film, advancement of special effects has also led to it being more realistic. In the first scene, where Pennywise takes his first victim, in the first movie the audience just sees pennywise with sharp teeth holding onto the kid and it fades away, while in the 2017 film, the audience sees Pennywise have a mouthful of razor sharp teeth like a shark open up to bite of the arm of Georgie, and then brings him into the sewer. There are many more examples of the increase in special effects, but this is probably the most effective since it is the first scene of the movie, it has the biggest effect with the audience, and from what I have scene, this is what most people remember the most of the movie, not a scene where balloons flood out of a refrigerator like it is supposed to be scary when instead it is actually quite comical, as seen in the first IT.
This film has some good comic relief to ease tensions with the audience, and this comical relief is actually meant to be funny, and when they do occur it works out pretty well as the whole audience, including me, would end up laughing at then. 
Lastly, the ending of the film was decent, not too good and it was quite generic, the group of outcast kids band together and beat their enemy, even though this enemy was a supernatural clown that not even a spear through the face was able to knock him off his feet, and they were fighting in hand to hand combat. And then at the closing of the film, the main character got with the girl he wanted, once again, just like in every other film. 
Overall, this film, which of course is located in Maine becuase every Steven King film and book has to be located in Maine, deserves a rating of an 8.5, it had some pretty flawless scenes with the proper amount of scariness and comical relief. The reason why it is not a 9 or a 10 is because some of the things are quite generic, on top of that, it seems to me that just about everyone in the town of Derry is either a jerk, criminal, or an outcast, there are no normal people, and this seems to be a staple for Stephen King movies.
