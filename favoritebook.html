<h2>Cop Under Fire (By Sheriff David Clarke)</h2>
My favorite book is Cop Under Fire, it is written by Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, an outspoken conservative in national politics. This is my favorite book because it discusses the various issues confronting the nation currently, such as Black Lives Matter protests, political correctness, how BLM is a fake organization only out to reap the benefits not granted to others in the name of equality, and much more. On top of that, he discusses his successes as sheriff of Milwaukee County, his reforms to the prison system, and how they have changed society in the sense of actually reforming criminals. Lastly, he discusses issues that are not just police related, but he brings up many other things, such as schooling, welfare, guns, and much more, bringing up some really good points such as police officers cannot be everwhere all the time so one should have a gun to defend themselves, when seconds matter, you cannot wait for 5-10 minutes for the police to arrive.

This is my favorite book for many reasons, it brings up the various issues confronting America, it is a conservative book that gives arguments in favor of conservative topics, it is written by Sheriff David Clarke, of whom I am a big fan of when it comes to national poltics for many reasons, and alson it is my favorite book because it gives reasons why his way of leading is successful, he gives many success stories on why his ideas work and that the liberal media that is trying to make it seem like it is not working is completely wrong, they are just out to oust him.  
<p>
There are not really any main characters in this book due to it being a nonfiction informative type book where he is just talking about and explaining things. Really the only character that is mentioned in the book is himself, David Clarke, he is the sheriff of Milwaukee County and is a well known conservative democrat. He campaigned for Donald Trump in 2016, he is famous for delivering a speech on law and order at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Also he is a well known constitutionalist, he strongly supports the 1st, 2nd, 10th, and every amendment in between, and many liberals dislike him for his defense on the 2nd amendment (he stated that citzens should not 100% depend on the police because in casesm, like home break-ins, when seconds matter, it still takes cops 5-10 minutes to arrive on the scene).
